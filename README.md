# Exercise 2: Graphic Creation 
Go to cadillac.com and choose a vehicle from the vehicles page, and design a 940px x 385px slide. Your slide must include: 
1) One or more features/benefits of the vehicle 
2) Pricing: there is a current limited-time offer of 0% APR for 36 months through the end of the current year. You'll need to use the website for imagery/assets. Brevity is okay. Use your creativity!
